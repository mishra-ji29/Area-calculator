# Area calculator

This is simple python project which I have made in my early python learning days.
This project was built to test my  skills on python, its loops and conditions.
In this project I have made simple area calculator which uses  basic maths to calculate 
  Area, Perimeter and Volume of surfaces.

# Upcoming
Soon I will be making a calculator with good UI which can even calculate area/volume of irregular shapes using calculus.
Stay tuned...
